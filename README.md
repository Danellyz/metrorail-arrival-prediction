# metrorail-arrival-prediction
This project uses Miami Metrorail GTFS data to build a web application that displays route and station information, analyzes historical train arrival data, and predicts future train arrival times using machine learning techniques. The system allows users to view schedules, select stations, and delay patterns across the Metrorail system.
